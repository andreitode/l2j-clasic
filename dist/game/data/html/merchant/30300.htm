Greetings, weary traveler! Blacksmith Pushkin, at your service.<br>
My brother Rupio and I were sent here by the Black Anvil Guild, and we won't stop until this shop is the best blacksmith shop in all Giran. I'm sorry to say that we don't have much to show for our efforts yet, but we'll do our best to meet -- nay, to exceed -- your expectations. What can I do for you today?<br>
