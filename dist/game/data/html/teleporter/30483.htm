My name is Mozella. I am one of the researchers dispatched from Oren's Ivory Tower to search for the secrets of the giants, lost inside the Tower of the Giants.<br>
If you wish to explore the mysterious ruins and brave their dangers, I will open the door of space and time and send you inside the tower.<br><br>
